# File Renamer
----
This project was written by Roy W. Gero. I was intending to use this project as a way for me to learn how to design a GUI in C# using Visual Studio. What the program does is rename every file of a certain extension to a pattern specified by the user. The reason I originally created this program was because when my camera hits 1000 pictures on its SD card, it creates a new folder. But rather than naming the next picture in that new folder "Pic1001.jpg", it chooses "Pic001.jpg." This leads to a rather annoying situation when I am combining the albums on my computer. This program allows me to resolve this quickly.

### Installation
There are two ways that you can get the executable file. The first way is to download this repo and build it yourself. The second is to get it from this link: https://www.dropbox.com/s/pusl4l6yula4k71/FileRenamer.zip?dl=0
